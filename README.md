# Network learning dataset

This project is a set of tools for generating a dataset of the training process
for neural networks. The goal of this dataset is to be used for model training
in meta Deep Learning.

## Installation

Installation consists in creating a virtual enviroment with virtualenv and
installing all the python requirements through pip.

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
